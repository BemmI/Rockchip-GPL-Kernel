**Build instructions:**

**Flash instructions for the MK908 device using Linux (use at own risk!):**
- Connect one end of the USB cable to your PC
- Press the reset button using a paperclip, and while pressed, connect the USB cable to the OTG USB port
- Release the reset button
- Run "./flash_omegamoon_kernel" to flash the kernel to the device
